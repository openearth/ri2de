        <p style="font-weight: bold">Article 1: Purpose of the Website</p>
        <p>
          1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This beta-Website was initiated as an
          internal knowledge tool for Deltares employees and is in keeping with
          Deltares’ policy on the sharing knowledge, made available to the
          public as a beta-version, hereinafter “the Website”.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Website aims to provide users help
          in identifying locations in their road network that are susceptible to
          natural hazards. RI2DE stands for <strong>R</strong>isk
          <strong>I</strong>ndicators for <strong>I</strong>nfrastructure in
          <strong>D</strong>atascarce <strong>E</strong>nvironments and as such
          is geared towards hazards and locations where little hazard
          information is available. The website identifies the susceptibility of
          infrastructure networks by combining several information layers
          relating to assets and infrastructure, and publicly available data
          about the environment. The user can fine tune the input to align with
          the local situation. The subsequent results should be calibrated using
          historical data and expert judgement prior to using the results. The
          results are displayed graphically on the Website and can be locally
          saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intended users are experts from
          government agencies e.g. national road authorities, road owners and
          other affiliated infrastructure organisations e.g. infrastructure
          experts, maintenance organisations, students and anyone interested.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can save the results of your session
          in RI2DE as a file (Report) on the device with which you are logged
          into the Website. Use of the results of a previous session is possible
          by opening this Report (file) with this Website, on this device or on
          any other computer. RI2DE is available for independent use.
